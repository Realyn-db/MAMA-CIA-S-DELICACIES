<p> <FONT COLOR=Red> <CENTER>Challenges Faced by the Founder — Etthelindita Navarro
<p> <FONT COLOR=khaki>Starting Mama Cias Delicacies during the COVID-19 pandemic was not easy for Etthelindita Navarro. One of her biggest challenges was the unstable supply of ingredients, as lockdowns made it difficult to buy flour, eggs, and packaging materials. She often had to adjust her schedule, find alternatives, and manage with what was available just to continue fulfilling customer orders.
<p> <FONT COLOR=khaki>Another challenge she faced was balancing her time between running the business and taking care of her family. Since everything was done at home, she had to bake, pack, market, and deliver products while still handling household responsibilities. There were days when fatigue, stress, and uncertainty made her question if the business could survive.
<p> <FONT COLOR=khaki>She also struggled with reaching customers at first, especially when face-to-face selling was limited. Etthelindita had to learn online selling, manage Facebook orders, and adapt to digital marketing even though it was new to her. But despite all these challenges, her determination, creativity, and strong support from her community helped her push through and continue growing Mama Cias Delicacies.
